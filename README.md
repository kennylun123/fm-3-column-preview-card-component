## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

- CUBE methodology
- CSS property transition
```
transition: background-color 200ms ease-in-out, color 200ms ease-in-out;
```
- I found that using `grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr;` will share equal amount of width for each item. In this situation, it is better than using `flex-direction: row;`.
